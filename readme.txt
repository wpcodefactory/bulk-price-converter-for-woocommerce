All-in-one bulk pricing converter for all your WooCommerce store products, set a fixed price, add a fixed amount or multiply prices for all your products with a couple of clicks.

== Description ==

Whether you want to change all your WooCommerce store products to a fixed price, add & subtract a fixed amount, or multiply & divide prices, the **Bulk Price Converter for WooCommerce** plugin will let you modify all WooCommerce products prices with single click.

If you're running sale across all your store and want to apply discount (percentage or fixed number), the plugin will let you apply this in no time.

Products costs & profit margins have changed? That's not an issue, change pricing by adding a fixed amount to all your store products in one click to update ALL your products prices.

*Bulk Price Converter tool* is located in "WooCommerce > Bulk Price Converter". Using the tool is very easy: set **direct price**, **multiply** and/or **add** values for all product prices, press **preview prices** and then **change prices** button. That's it!

The free version of this plugin will let you do most of the tasks you want, here is a quick overview of plugin options:
**1- Set a Direct Price:** Will let you change ALL your products prices to a fixed price, useful if you sell products that are close to each other in price, and then you want to go for a fixed price for all your store (think of Udemy when they run site-wide deals at $10 for example).
**2- Multiply Prices:** While it's called "multiply", but you can actually divide as well, by multiplying products prices with a decimal less than 1, so if you want to reduce prices by 20%, you can use this option and multiply all prices by 0.8 to apply 20% across all your store.
**3- Add Prices:** Similar to multiply, you can add or subtract (by adding a negative number) to all your product prices at once. This is very handy when your costs increase/decrease and can affect margins, you can use this feature to change all your store prices with a single click.
**4- Sale/Regular Price Change:** This option will allow you to select whether you want to apply options 1,2 or 3 to the sale price, regular price, or both prices on your store.
